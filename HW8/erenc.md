The plotted figure is elegant so the opportunity for improvement is in the related text elements, not the data area itself.

First, it needs a title.  (The only way to understand is to follow the Python code).  The labels do add a clue but are still ambiguous.  The vertical axis label simply states that it is a function of X1 and X2, which can already be reasonably assumed. 

A title or legend would also clear up ambiguity of the data range (is it arbitrary) and grid range (again, arbitrary?)

Otherwise, the background and gridlines are helpful -- not always the case -- as they are more helpful as visual cues in a 3D plot.

SUGGESTIONS: Add title and make the labels more "plain English."
