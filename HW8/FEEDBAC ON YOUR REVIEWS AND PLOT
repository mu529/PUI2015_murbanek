excellent reviews really! 10/10


NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

interesting plot: the choice of plotting with small points allows the structure in the data to be seen

robust to color blindness

the three default dots in the legend should be changed to 1 as they are redudnant


NOTES ON YOUR PLOT THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================


diegosmiles
============

color unexplained

size redundant with y position. this rather than clarify the value enforces the concept and leaves a strong impression on the reader, influencing their opinion.

a ticks too small



erenc
============

the 3d obstructs the structure, but the structure is symmetric so this is justified

the color is redundant with the z axis, but it helos read the y value in the 3D structure

the z axis label is ambiguous: spell the function out

the axis labels are too small to be readable



carlyleadavis
============
compact visualization that summarized a lot of the data structure. 

however there is a conceptual problem for this plot when it is used for a time series rather than categories. the reader is invariably given the impression that finance (blue here) lags behind in time w respect to the yellow category. this is the wrong (and in fact meaningless) impression but it is distracting.

y label ambiguous

what year are we referring to? include in title

a legend should tell whether the dotted and dashed lines are the mean or the median and the quirtiles or what else, though that can also be included in the caption. 


the mean (median?) would be better displayed as a solid line to further separate it from the quartiles (it woudl be hardin the caption to refer to the in words and disinguish them)
