This is a creative way to display a LOT of information -- the first time I've ever seen this type of plot -- and I understood it quickly, without sensing clutter!

With so much information, it becomes more important to scrutinize every single element as the risk of confu
sion will be higher.

While the dotted lines for quartiles do add marginally, their positions can be inferred with sufficient accuracy based on the shape of the distribution.  Consider plotting only the median, along with a legend entry.

While the legend doesn't need its own title, but it does need a background.

The horizontal axis is self-evident, but the vertical is not.  Commas on the numerical figures improve readability (especially given that the scale is "real" and not an abstract measurement).  The label needs to be spelled out, along with the unit of measurement. 

You may also play with a plot border instead of grid lines to get a simpler look without losing information.
