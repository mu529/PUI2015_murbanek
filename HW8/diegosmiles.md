The scatter immediately displays some level of positive correlation between two measures clearly stated in the title.

However there is no explanation for the colors or point diameters. The eye does not pick up a pattern in the colors, and after some examination, the diameters appear to duplicate one of the axis values.  The guesswork takes away from the message.

The axis labels are spelled out.  Consider making the unit measures consistently abbreviated.  This would also allow an increase in the label font size, which help readability.  In general the axis labels need to be stronger if using the checked background.  The plot background is a nice, simple clean white.

Regarding the data: if the vertical axis is a measure of absolute, which the other axis is a per-person ratio, try more specific labeling to highlight the assemtry.

It might depending on the data; but if it is an absolute, is the phenomenon intuitive enough to go without a more explicit label?

If the dot sizes do represent unique information, they are nicely small enough to be differentiated on their location.

So, the general theme of suggestions is to play with text size, add a legend perhaps with scale for points (if applicable), and check your text capitalization.
